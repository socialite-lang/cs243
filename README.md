# CS243 HW 6

Analysis of DBLP co-authorship graph.

Two example analysis algorithms -- shortest-paths and PageRank -- are 
implemented in code/sp.py and code/pr.py
To run the algrithms, do the following steps:
* run setup.sh to uncompress the DBLP data. (make sure you have bunzip2 and untar).
* socialite/bin/socialite code/sp.py

If something does not work, have a look at the log in logs/socialite.log
